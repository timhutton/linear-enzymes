# linear-enzymes
Artificial chemistry where chains of atoms can catalyse reactions. Unpublished.

[Live demo](https://timhutton.github.io/linear-enzymes/enzymes_demo/) shows a short molecule being replicated by 21 free floating enzymes:

Compare with [https://github.com/timhutton/squirm3](https://github.com/timhutton/squirm3) where the reactions just happen magically - they are hard-coded into the simulation. Here the enzymes are made of the same stuff as the rest of the world and can be assembled and manipulated in the same way.

[Compaction demo](https://timhutton.github.io/linear-enzymes/compaction_demo/) shows how allowing multiple atoms to occupy a square under some circumstances can reduce the computation needed and allow more flexibility:
